<h1>How to deal with a problem in {{ $azure['name'] }} </h1>
<p>You may occasionally come across the odd misbehaving {{ $azure['name'] }} . Never fear, help is at hand! On this page we&apos;ll tell
    you what tools work best in tricky situations.</p>
<h2>In a room</h2>
<p>When you&apos;re in a room and another  {{ $azure['name'] }} is being out-of-line, click on their avatar and a drop-down menu will
    appear. This lets you either ignore, moderate or in really disruptive cases, report them.</p>
<h4>Ignoring a {{ $azure['name'] }} </h4>
<p>If <strong>a  {{ $azure['name'] }} is saying things which make you feel uncomfortable</strong>, you can put them on ignore. This is
    an ideal solution for teasing, spamming or when you simply want to say &quot;Bye Felicia!&quot; but don&apos;t know
    how.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click on their avatar. A drop-down menu will appear.</li>
    <li>Choose the <em>Ignore</em> option.</li>
    <li>You won&apos;t see what the  {{ $azure['name'] }} says anymore. If you want to un-ignore later, click the avatar again and
        choose <em>Listen</em>.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>Moderating a {{ $azure['name'] }} </h4>
<p><strong>In your own rooms, or if you have room rights</strong>, you can decide who can visit the room, and you have
    the power to mute, kick or ban other users. This allows you to play an active part in the general  {{ $azure['name'] }} moderation
    and to contribute to a safer and more enjoyable community.</p>
