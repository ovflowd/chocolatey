Chatting in Habbo
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h1>How chatting works</h1><span class="padding-top"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>To start chatting you simply select the text box on the bottom of the screen and
    type the text you want to say. </p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>

        size="12px"><p></p></font><p><font size="9"> </font></p><span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>When you have
    finished typing, press enter or click the &quot;say&quot; button, and your text will appear in a speech bubble at
    the top of the room. The bubble will appear above the location where your avatar is standing. Speech bubbles will
    gradually move up with time or by being pushed upward by newer chat bubbles.</p><span

<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>To continue chatting, simply start typing in the text box at the bottom of the
    screen.</p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p><b>Who was that talking?</b></p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>You can quickly find out who was chatting by clicking on the speech bubble and
    selecting the corresponding avatar to see where they are standing in the room. You can then open their context menu
    and infostand!</p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h3>Automatic Flood Control & Mute</h3><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>We monitor rooms for attempts of &quot;flooding&quot; the room by chatting.
    Should you do this you will be automatically silenced for a short period of time. Don't be alarmed if this happens,
    we are simply allowing others in the room to talk too! You will be able to chat again normally when the mute period
    has been removed.</p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p><b>Moderator / Room owner mute</b></p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>Room owners and moderators have the authority to mute you for a longer period if
    they think you are engaging in inappropriate behavior. If you are muted, you will receive a message about why this
    has happened in a separate window.</p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>

        class="padding-top"><br></span><p><b>Chat Styles</b></p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>You can select from a range of styles for your chat bubble using the box to the
    left of the text box. Those who purchase Habbo Club memberships, will receive an exciting range of additional speech
    bubble styles. But we do often add special styles during Campaigns for non Habbo Club members too.</p><span

<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p><b>Other Habbos typing a message</b></p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>When another Habbo is typing, you will see a small speech bubble with an
    ellipses next to the avatar that is currently typing a new message.</p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p><b>Hearing Range</b></p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>When chatting, each Habbo only hears a circle around them so your chat will not
    necessarily be heard across the room. By default, these 'hearing' circles are quite large - 14 tiles in diameter.
    Room owners can control the size of the circles in settings, if they wish.</p><span

<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p><b>Whispering</b></p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>To whisper to another Habbo, simply click on their avatar and choose the whisper
    option from the context menu. Or for quick access use the <b>:whisper &lt;username&gt;</b> command in the input
    field. Your chat will not be visible to anyone else in the room. </p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>

<span class="padding-top"><br></span><h2>Chat History Browsing</h2><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>
<span class="padding-top"><br></span><p>Your local Habbo will store all chat bubble history for up to 1000 items, per
    session. To reveal the history, move your cursor to the top of the screen where a 'handle' appears. Click the handle
    and pull down to reveal the chat history. If you have moved rooms, these previous room chats will appear in red text
    and the bubbles will be in the order they appeared, time-stamped with your local time when you received them. To
    scroll through the chat history, simply pull it upward or downward to scroll (like on a smartphone), or use blue
    scroll-bar on the right to quickly navigate. </p><span class="padding-bottom"><br></span>

    a shortcut to using your mouse, or to enhance your Habbo chat experience! </p><span
